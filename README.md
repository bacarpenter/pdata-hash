# pdata-hash
A small set of typescript scripts to turn personal data into a hashed value. My thinking was this: The COVID-19 vacine roll out is of the upmost importance at this time. I also know that many people are uncomfortable with the government having a large list of people, however, we will need to make appointments to get the vacine. So, I built an small program that can make sure that the person who made an appointment is the same person showing up for it, by having them varify their information at the door. If they do not give the right information for the right appointent, the varifaction will fail. And, even if you have the varification code, you (I belive) can't then get the personal data from it.

## Usage
So long as you have Node installed, you can run `node testHash.js`
